## 2-Step Approach to Using AI-powered API Workflows

SharpAPI's AI-powered endpoints follow a straightforward 2-step process that ensures effective task management and optimal performance for content generation, data processing, and more. Here’s how it works:

### Step 1: Dispatching the AI Job

The first step is to submit a job request to the relevant AI endpoint. This is done via a `POST` request, where you provide the required parameters in the request body. After submitting the request, SharpAPI will initiate the processing job and respond with a `job_id` and a `status_url` in the response, allowing you to track the progress of the job.

**Example: Dispatching a Content Paraphrase Job**

```http
POST /api/v1/content/paraphrase
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "content": "Exploring the vibrant tech industry, we discover amazing advancements.",
    "voice_tone": "enthusiastic",
    "language": "English"
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
    "status_url": "https://sharpapi.com/api/v1/content/paraphrase/job/status/5de4887a-0dfd-49b6-8edb-9280e468c210",
    "job_id": "5de4887a-0dfd-49b6-8edb-9280e468c210"
}
```

The response will contain:
- `status_url`: A URL to check the job’s status.
- `job_id`: A unique identifier for the job request.
  
This `job_id` is also included in the `SharpAPI-Job-Id` header for easier tracking. Additionally, the `Retry-After` header specifies how long to wait before polling for results.

### Step 2: Checking Job Status & Retrieving Results

Once the job has been dispatched, you can track its progress using the `status_url` obtained from Step 1. This is done via a `GET` request. The status will be updated as the job processes, eventually indicating a `success` or `failed` outcome. If successful, the response will include the processed results.

**Polling Example: Checking Job Status**
```http
GET https://sharpapi.com/api/v1/content/paraphrase/job/status/5de4887a-0dfd-49b6-8edb-9280e468c210
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Accept: application/json
```

**Response for Pending Job:**
```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "api_job",
        "id": "5de4887a-0dfd-49b6-8edb-9280e468c210",
        "attributes": {
            "status": "pending",
            "type": "content_paraphrase"
        }
    }
}
```

**Response for Completed Job:**
```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "api_job_result",
        "id": "5de4887a-0dfd-49b6-8edb-9280e468c210",
        "attributes": {
            "status": "success",
            "type": "content_paraphrase",
            "result": {
                "paraphrase": "As we delve into the dynamic tech sector, we witness remarkable progress."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this final response:
- The `status` field changes to `success` when the job is complete, along with the paraphrased content or other requested output in the `result` field.
- In case of a failure, the `status` field will display `failed`, and details will be provided for further troubleshooting. If a job fails, no processing fee is charged, and you can retry the job.

**Best Practices for Using the 2-Step Approach**

1. **Optimize Polling Intervals**: Use the `Retry-After` header to avoid excessive polling and manage API rate limits effectively.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling based on the `status` field to ensure smooth reattempts for failed jobs.
3. **Tracking with `SharpAPI-Job-Id`**: Use the `SharpAPI-Job-Id` header for improved job tracking, especially if you’re managing multiple concurrent jobs.
4. **Cost Awareness**: Monitor `SharpAPI-Cost` headers in the responses to track API usage costs for budgeting and optimization.

This 2-step process is designed to handle AI-powered tasks efficiently, ensuring timely and reliable results for applications ranging from content creation to advanced data processing. By integrating this workflow, you can streamline various tasks and enhance the overall functionality of your applications using SharpAPI's robust AI capabilities.

### Note on Job Failures

Occasionally, an AI job may fail to complete successfully. Failures can occur due to several reasons, such as temporary service interruptions, input validation issues, or AI model limitations. When a job fails, the `status` field in the response will be set to `failed`, and specific error details will be provided to assist with troubleshooting. 

**Common Reasons for Job Failure**:
- **Invalid Input**: If input parameters don’t meet required specifications, the job may fail due to validation errors.
- **AI Model Limitations**: Some complex or ambiguous inputs may not be fully processed by the AI model.
- **Service Downtime**: Temporary service disruptions or network issues could result in a failed job.

Rest assured, no charges are incurred for failed jobs, and you can simply retry the request after addressing the issue. For optimized handling, consider implementing error-checking and retry logic to ensure a smooth user experience.

---

## Utility Endpoints: `PING` and `QUOTA`

SharpAPI includes simple utility endpoints like `PING` and `QUOTA` to help you manage and monitor your API usage efficiently. These endpoints provide valuable information for ensuring your application’s smooth operation and staying informed about API limits and usage.

### `PING` Endpoint

The `PING` endpoint is a lightweight endpoint used to check the availability and responsiveness of the SharpAPI service. This is particularly useful for health checks in your application, allowing you to verify the API is up and running before making further requests.

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/ping`
- **Purpose**: Confirms the API's operational status.
- **Example Request**:
    ```http
    GET /api/v1/ping
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    Accept: application/json
    ```
- **Example Response**:
    ```json
    {
        "ping": "pong",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-12T08:50:11.188308Z"
    }
    ```
  
If you receive a successful response, it means the API is functional, and you can proceed with other requests confidently. If the ping check fails, it could indicate temporary downtime or network issues.

### `QUOTA` Endpoint

The `QUOTA` endpoint provides a summary of your current API usage limits and the remaining resources within your selected pricing plan. By calling this endpoint, you can monitor your usage in real-time, helping you stay within your allocated credits and avoid unexpected service interruptions.

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/quota`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves information on available and consumed API quota.
- **Example Request**:
    ```http
    GET /api/v1/quota
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    Accept: application/json
    ```
- **Example Response**:
    ```json
    {
        "timestamp": "2024-03-19T07:06:23.180548Z",
        "on_trial": false,
        "trial_ends": "2024-03-17T07:57:46.000000Z",
        "subscribed": true,
        "current_subscription_start": "2024-03-18T12:37:39.000000Z",
        "current_subscription_end": "2024-04-18T12:37:39.000000Z",
        "subscription_words_quota": 100000,
        "subscription_words_used": 0,
        "subscription_words_used_percentage": 0
    }
    ```
  
In this example:
  - `subscription_words_quota` represents the total allowed words for the current plan.
  - `subscription_words_used` indicates the number of words consumed.
  - `subscription_words_used_percentage` shows the current usage percentage of the word quota.
  - `current_subscription_end` specifies when the subscription period will renew.

### 402 Payment Required Error

When calling various SharpAPI endpoints, including the AI-powered endpoints, you may encounter a `402 Payment Required` HTTP response. This response indicates that you have exhausted the available quota on your current subscription, and further processing requires additional credits or an upgrade in your subscription.

**Example 402 Response**:
```json
{
    "code": "GEN-PAYMENT-REQUIRED",
    "message": "You have exceeded your monthly words quota [100000]. Please login to the dashboard and increase number of credits."
}
```

The `402 Payment Required` response helps prevent unintentional overages by stopping further processing until you add credits or upgrade your plan. To avoid encountering this error, regularly check your quota status using the `QUOTA` endpoint and adjust your plan as necessary through the SharpAPI dashboard.

### Best Practices

- **Use `PING` for Application Health Checks**: Incorporate regular `PING` calls as part of your application's health monitoring system to ensure the API is responsive.
- **Monitor Quota with `QUOTA`**: Regularly check your usage with `QUOTA` to prevent service interruptions due to reaching quota limits. Set up alerts or notifications based on `subscription_words_used_percentage` to stay informed when your usage approaches the limit.
- **Watch for `402 Payment Required` Responses**: When interacting with SharpAPI’s endpoints, handle the `402 Payment Required` response by redirecting users to upgrade options or by notifying your team to add more credits.

These utility endpoints, along with careful monitoring of quota status, will help you maintain a consistent and reliable experience with SharpAPI.
